          Our fake product identification system using blockchain technology
          assigns a unique digital ID to each product that is recorded on the
          blockchain. Consumers can scan the product QR code or enter its
          digital ID on our website to verify its authenticity and ensure it has
          not been tampered with or counterfeited. By leveraging the security
          and transparency of the blockchain, our system provides a reliable and
          efficient way to combat product counterfeiting and protect consumers
          safety and trust.
